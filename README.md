# Gulp Tasks

This is just a small collection of gulp tasks I made that I like re-using in my
projects. Maybe you'll find them useful too.

NOTE: I haven't had time to make some nice examples and a lot of the folder
path references point to folders that don't exist in this repo (but would
presumably exist in your real project where you would be using these tasks).
Take care to read the code and adjust it to your needs ;)
